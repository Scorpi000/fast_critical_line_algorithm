A Fast Implementation of Markowitz's Critical Line Algorithm
============================================================

This repository provides a fast implementation of Markowitz's Critical Line Algorithm 
in Fortran with bindings in Matlab and Python. See the README files in [src](src/) for a 
description of its usage and compatibility information. The directory [packages](packages/) 
contains packages with binaries for Matlab and Python.

The details of the algorithm are described in detail in
Niedermayer, Andras and Niedermayer, Daniel (2010): Applying Markowitz's Critical Line 
Algorithm, Handbook of Portfolio Construction, Handbook of Portfolio Construction, 
pp. 383-400 [link](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-77439-8_12)

See also the the [working paper version](http://ideas.repec.org/p/ube/dpvwib/dp0701.html).

Note that currently the Matlab bindings are for Matlab version up to 7.0 on Windows 
(32 bit) and need to be adapted in order to be used with newer versions of Matlab.
